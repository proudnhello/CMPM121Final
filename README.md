# Devlog Entry - 11/15/24
## Introducing the Team:
Engine Co-Lead - Ethan Heffan
Engine Co-Lead - Arjun Krishnan
Design Co-Lead - Eric Wang
Tools Lead - Moore Macauley
Design Co-Lead - Igor Bessa
## Tools and materials
1. We’re planning on using Godot. Most of our engine experience comes from Unity, so we’re hoping to broaden our game dev horizons by learning an up and coming engine that isn’t too dissimilar from what we already know. While we could have used Unreal, Arjun and Ethan have some, albeit limited experience in Godot, so we figured it would be our best bet.
2. Godot has a variety of languages, but we’ll probably stick with C# because we’re all already familiar through Unity, so it’ll be the easiest way to transition to an entirely new engine. We might end up having to encounter C++, GDScript, or Godot’s Visual Scripting language depending on the requirements. For data processing we plan to use JSON files. For instance, we might use JSON to define the initial state of the grid or how it updates. 
3. The main tools we’ll use are VSCode for our IDE which’ll let us access GitHub for version control. For making 2D assets, we’ll probably use Photoshop and Aseprite and whatever relevant free assets we find online. If we need to make any 3D assets, we plan to use Blender, and we plan to use the equivalent of Unity’s scene view in Godot to create our levels.
4. Our alternate platform choices are to swap our code from C# into C++ . Since Godot is compatible with both of these programming languages, and we all have some experience with C++ through our CSE classes, we hope to have a relatively seamless swap between the two languages.
## Outlook
1. Our team is hoping to become more proficient at using Godot. We felt that with Unity’s recent actions only knowing Unity is probably not our best move, so we wanted to pick up a different engine. 
2. The hardest part will be learning how to use Godot since none of us have much experience. 
3. We are hoping to learn Godot and gain experience utilizing several Game Development Patterns to streamline the coordination process. We are also hoping to practice using GitHub in a group setting for collaboration.
